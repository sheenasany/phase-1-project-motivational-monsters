The Basic Story of Application
Motivational Monsters is a single page app that has monsters (static images/ animated images/stickers) floating on the page with a galaxy background. Each monster will be labeled with different common struggles for people in a coding bootcamp; i.e. “swamp snake monster” [from our end of day surveys] or “imposter monster” [the imposter syndrome], or “timesuck monster” [having time-management issues]. When you click or mouse over (tbd), you get randomly generated inspirational quotes. There’ll also be a form to submit the users custom positive quotes or general feedback of the quote (tbd), and a like button to show their appreciation for the randomized quote that they receive from a click event.
 
The Core Features of MVP

Successful user interaction with mouse over event (to possibly show a little animation of monster or a randomly generated quote), click events, and form submission from external api.
 
The API Data 

https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373 
 
Challenges To Overcome
 
- Getting the animation/static images on the page without using an API
- Extracting specific keys and hiding other keys when using API as we only want to include the quote itself and not the author
- Getting the mouse over event to work on the animated images of the monsters
- Having issues connecting with the API if we go over quota (see link above)
- Using the correct array iteration to manipulate API data for our specific API of choice (see link above) 
 
Requirements of The Project

We are going to use VS code to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and stylesheets to make a functional single page web application as a MVP (Minimal V), pulling data from the provided API with forEach array method to iterate through the randomized data as well as 3 unique event listeners (mouse over, submit, and click).
